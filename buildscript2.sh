#==========================================================================================================================
# Author: Brayan Molina

# Description: Demonstrate your ability to create a script that will automatically check the
# serverâ€™s processes and system performance.
#==========================================================================================================================
#  	                               Potential issues/bugs:
# 1. When given the option to kill a process, a user can still enter a value of any process rather than just the ones shown.
#==========================================================================================================================

#Color variables used for my output in the script.
green='\e[0;32m'
red='\e[0;31m'

#These options reflect a manual or automatic option I built. The user's choice is stored in variable pchoice.
#Pressing 2 = automatic will check for processes utilizing 30% or more of the systems memory.
#Pressing 1 = manual will provide the user with more instructions and allow them to input a specific value
#for memory% when checking processes. (i.e if user inputs 10 only processes using >10% mem will be shown)
